# Attribution
I greatly appreciate the work of Jacob Vlijm who created dslli in response to my original question on [AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/815032/how-can-i-quickly-disable-standby-lid-off-in-ubuntu-unity-16-04). My mere intention with this repository is to structure his work and prepare it to provide a package that can be easily installed by new users. Moreover, I want to sincerely thank the user [probono](http://discourse.appimage.org/users/probono/summary) who helped me on the [AppImage Community Forum](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/hello-world-example/161/5) to create a universally installable package.
